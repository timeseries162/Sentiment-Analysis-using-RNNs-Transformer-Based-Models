# Sentiment-Analysis-using-RNNs-Transformer-Based-Models

In this project we analyse the performance of different types of machine learning algorithms at classifying sentiment in text data. We use traditional Bag-of-Words based model -Naive Bayes, word2vec based model â€“ Long Short-Term Memory Neural Network and transformer-based models- ALBERT, BERT-Expert and ELECTRA. We define the architecture of the different models in detail, apply them to classify real world data and compare their performance and accuracy again each other. Details about the implementation and the final results are discussed in the paper.
